In JBoss BPM Suite the state of the process instance is persisted when the process execution reaches a safe point:
Safe points are: end nodes, wait state and nodes marked as 'async'.
As the process is executed in the context of a JTA transaction, in case of an error the transaction is rolled back to the previous persisted state.
