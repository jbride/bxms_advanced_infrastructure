The configuration and deployments for Business Central and the KIE-SERVER need also to be persisted in a way that the configuration and deployments can survive a server restart.
The business central uses for the purpose of persisting its configuration and deployments: the System Git repository and the database to persist the deployments information.
The KIE-SERVER (also known as decision or process server) uses the file system to persist the configuration and deployments of unmanaged instances.
When the KIE-SERVER is a managed instance by a business central controller, the KIE-SERVER will use the business central to store its configuration and deployment information, the business central will use the system git and the database as stated before.
