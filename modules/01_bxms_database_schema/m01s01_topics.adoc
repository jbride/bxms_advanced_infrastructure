Transcript:

This module examines the data persistence challenges when implementing JBoss BPM Suite. It begins with a detailed discussion, with videos, of three categories of persistence: design-time data persistence, configuration and deployments persistence, and runtime data persistence. The module continues with a look at persistence technology, persistence and safe points, binary serialization, and extending persistence, followed by explanations of optimistic and pessimistic locking. The module concludes with datasource configuration and database maintenance.
