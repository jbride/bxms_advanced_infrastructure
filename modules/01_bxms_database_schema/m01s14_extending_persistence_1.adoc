Transcript:

To extend the default persistence options and functionality, JBoss BPM Suite supports custom marshalling strategies that can extend the persistence schema of JBoss BPM Suite for process and task variables.

To extend persistence with custom marshalling strategies:

* Model variables as persistable entities using JPA annotations
* Include a `persistence.xml` JPA descriptor file in the KJAR to define additional persistent classes
* Register the `JPAPlaceholderResolverStrategy` in the KJAR deployment descriptor
