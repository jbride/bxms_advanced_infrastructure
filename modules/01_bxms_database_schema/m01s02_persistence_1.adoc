== Persistence in JBoss BPMS/BRMS

* Persistence types:
** Design-time persistence
** Configuration and deployments
** Runtime data persistence

ifdef::showscript[]

When examining the persistence type options available for JBoss BPM Suite we find that we can classify the persistence configuration in the following categories:
* Design-time persistence
* Configuration and deployments persistence
* Runtime data persistence

Each one of these categories need to be accounted when facing the challenges of sharing information between the teams and keep the information alive and ready for review and analysis.
