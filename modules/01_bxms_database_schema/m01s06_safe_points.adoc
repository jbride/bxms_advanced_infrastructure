== Persistence and safe points

* When is persistence happening in BPMS?
** When process execution reaches a safe point
** Safe points are:
*** End node
*** Wait state
*** Node marked as async
** Process excution happens in the context of a JTA transaction.
** In case of error, rollback to previous persisted state.
