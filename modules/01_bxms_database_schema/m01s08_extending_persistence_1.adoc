== Extending Persistence

* Non-transactional data stores do not roll back in case of error
** Manual synchronization may be necessary
* Process and task variables not duplicated to external store
** JBoss BPM Suite database contains only pointer to external data
** Consider alternative solutions, such as through process or task listeners
