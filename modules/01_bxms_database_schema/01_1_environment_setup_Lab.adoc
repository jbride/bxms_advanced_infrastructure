= Course Introduction Lab

== Course Overview

Welcome to the _BXMS Advanced Infrastructure_ course offered by Red Hat's _Global Partner and Technical Enablement_ (GPTE) team..

The intent of this course is to teach you best practices regarding the provisioning and administration of secure, highly available, load-balanced BPM and Rules production environments.

== Course Prerequisites

=== Skills

. Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) (or equivalent)
. Experience using Red Hat Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) v6
. Experience using Jenkins and Maven
. Experience using Git (at the command line)
. Completion of Red Hat GPTE's _OpenShift Enterprise Implementation_ course.
. Completion of Red Hat GPTE's _xPaaS Development using OpenShift Enterprise_ course.

=== Local workstation resources

This course includes a virtual machine preinstalled with the required tools.
This VM is provided in VDI format and can be run on your local workstation using VirtualBox.

Subsequently, your local workstation will require the following:

* Installation of the 64-bit link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox application] on your local workstation.
+
NOTE:  64 bit Virtual Box is mandatory.  32 bit Virtual Box will not work for this course.

* A minimum of two 64-bit CPUs and 4 GB RAM dedicated to the VM used in the course

== Lab Virtual Machine
In this section you install the {coursevdi}  on your local workstation.

=== Acquire
If you are participating in an on-site Instructore Led Training (ILT), the instructor will pass around a thumb drive with the course virtual machine.

If you are taking this course remotely, then you'll have to gain access to the course virtual machine through different means.

There are two methods: either download VirtualBox directly or use BitTorrent.
If you are familiar with BitTorrent and have a BitTorrent client, this method is usually much faster and more reliable.

* BitTorrent: Download `bxms_advanced_infrastructure_1.0.torrent` found at https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-lab-etc/raw/master/etc/gpte-bpms-advanced-630.vdi.torrent.
Using your BitTorrent client, open the torrent file and download `gpte-bxms-advanced-infrastructure-630.vdi`.

== BPMS Business-Central and Kie-server

The virtual machine comes with a script that will install and configure BPMS Business-Central and Kie-server. +
The script will install a separate instance of Business-Central and Kie-server.
This reflects a realistic installation setup where Business-Central is used at design time and where Kie-server is used as the process/rules execution runtime.

=== Review

. In the virtual machine, open a terminal window.
. Ensure you are using the _jboss_ operating system user and change to the `/home/jboss/lab` directory.
. Review the `install-bpms.sh` shell script.  Notice that the script will create two instances of BPMS:
.. `home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc` : Business-Central workbench and DashBuilder. No Kie-server.
.. `home/jboss/lab/bpms/kieserver` : Kie-server execution runtime, no Business-Central nor DashBuilder.
. Also notice that the script itself delegates to the `install-bpms-instance.sh` script in the `/opt/install/scripts/bpms` directory.
. As part of the installation, a number of system properties have been set in the `standalone.conf` file in `home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc/bin` and `home/jboss/lab/bpms/kieserver/bin`. +
Review these system property values as they give a good idea of the system properties that should be set for a BPMS installation.
. The Kie-server instance is configured with a port-offset of 150 - the HTTP port will be 8230 rather than 8080. This allows to run both the Business-Central as the Kie-server instance concurrently.
. The installed instances are configured to use the built-in H2 database. As part of the labs you will complete the configuration to point to MariaDB instead.

. Based on your review of the provided scripts and configuration files, try to answer the following questions:
.. What two users will be configured for both the `kieserver` and `business-central` environments and what will be their passwords ?
.. Where will you be able to find all of the Java system properties that define the runtime behavior of the `kieserver` and `business-central` environments ?
.. Once started, what network interfaces of the virtual machine would you expect your `kieserver` and `business-central` runtimes to bind to ?
.. Is a MySQL JDBC driver jar file already included in the virtual machine ?

=== Install
To install the BPMS instances on the virtual machines:

. If not already there, change to the `/home/jboss/lab` directory, and execute the `install-bpms.sh` script.
+
-----
./install-bpms.sh
-----

. The script should complete without errors.
. The Kie-server instance is configured as an unmanaged instance. If you would like to use the Business-Central instance as a controller for Kie-server, uncomment the following lines:
.. `/home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc/bin/standalone.conf`
+
----
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.user=jboss"
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.pwd=bpms"

=== Virtual Box Guest Additions
The default display resolution of the virtual machine is rather low (1042 x 768) .
The small display can lead to a frustrating experience as you're trying to work through the labs of this course.

Virtual Box allows virtual machines to use the full resolution of a hosts display via its `Guest Additions`.

Assuming you are using a host laptop with high resolution, enabling your Virtual Box environment to make use of `Guest Additions` is highly recommended.

Do so as follows:

==== Install `Guest Additions` for your host

===== Linux
The Virtual Box install available from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads comes pre-installed with `Guest Additions`.

No futher tasks needed if you've installed Virtual Box from the above download site.

===== OSX

===== Windows

==== Enable `Guest Additions` in the virtual machine

. Ensure the virtual machine is started.
. In the top panel of the virtual box window, click `Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image`.
+
image::images/select_ga.png[]

. You will be prompted with an option to run the contents of the `Guest Additions` CD.
+
Ensure that `Open Autorun Prompt`option from the drop-down is selected and click `OK`.
+
image::images/ga_prompt.png[]
. The next prompt will ask whether you choose to run the `Guest Additions` software.  Click `Run`.
+
image::images/ga_run.png[]
. You will be prompted for the password of the `root` operating system user.
+
Enter `jboss` and click `Authenticate`.
. A terminal window in the VM should automatically pop-up and begin to build the `Guest Additions kernel modules` in the VM.
+
Give it a minute or two.  Eventually you will be prompted to `Press Return to close the window`.
+
image::images/ga_building.png[]

. Bounce your virtual machine

==== Increase screen resolution of VM

. Once the VM is restarted, navigate to the following in the virtual machine: `System -> Preferences -> Hardware -> Displays`
+
image::images/nav_display.png[]
. Click the `Resolution` selection drop down.
+
Notice that you now have many more resolution options.  Select the highest display resolution provided by your host operating system.
+
image::images/display_options.png[]
. At the bottom of the `Monitor Preferences` pop-up, click:  `Apply`.

ifdef::showscript[]

Add the following to the VM;

1)  firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8380/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8230/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8000/tcp --permanent
