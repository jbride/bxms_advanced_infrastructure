== Set Up Lab Environment

In this section, you download the course VM, install VirtualBox, and start the VM.

ifdef::showscript[]
There are two methods: either download VirtualBox directly or use BitTorrent.
If you are familiar with BitTorrent and have a BitTorrent client, this method is usually much faster and more reliable.

=== Use BitTorrent
. Download the link:https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/advanced-process-development-labs-etc/raw/master/etc/gpte-bpms-advanced-630.vdi.torrent[course VM torrent file^].

. Using your BitTorrent client, open the `gpte-bxms-advanced-infrastructure-630.vdi` torrent file.

=== Use VirtualBox
endif::showscript[]

. Download the {course_vm}.
+
[NOTE]
If you are participating in on-site instructor-led training (ILT), expect to receive the VM from your instructor.

. If you have not already done so, download link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox^] and install it on your local workstation.
+
[NOTE]
The course virtual machine is a 64-bit VM, so make sure that the `amd64` version of VirtualBox is installed and that virtualization is enabled in your host machine's BIOS. Refer to VirtualBox's online documentation for assistance in configuring it for your workstation.

. Start VirtualBox and navigate to *Machine -> New*.
. In the *Create Virtual Machine* panel, populate the fields as follows:
* *Name*: `gpte-bxms-advanced-infrastructure`
* *Type*: `Linux`
* *Version*: `Red Hat (64-bit)`
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Memory* panel, specify `4096 MB` of RAM and click *Next*.
. In the *Hard Disk* panel:
.. Select *Use an existing virtual hard disk file*.
.. Browse your hard drive and select the previously downloaded `gpte-bxms_advanced_infra-1.1.vdi` image.
.. Click *Create*.
. Click *Start*.
* The VM starts and displays the *MATE* window manager login screen:
+
image:images/wm_login.png[]

. Select `jboss` as the user and enter `jboss` as the password:
+
NOTE: The `jboss` operating system user has `sudo` access.

. Click *Log In*.
+
[TIP]
Enable VirtualBox Guest Additions to allow the VM to use the full display resolution of your host machine. Additional information is provided in the last section of this lab: <<vbga>>.

== Install JBoss BPM Suite

The course VM comes with a script to install and configure JBoss BPM Suite's Business Central and Intelligent Process Server. For OpenShift, Intelligent Process Server is also known as "Intelligent Process Server for OpenShift." The script installs separate instances of Business Central and Intelligent Process Server. This reflects a realistic installation setup where Business Central is used at design time and where Intelligent Process Server is used as the process/rules execution runtime.

=== Review JBoss BPM Suite Install Script

. In the VM, open a terminal window.
. Make sure you are logged in as `jboss` and change to the `/home/jboss/lab` directory.
. Review the `install-bpms.sh` shell script.
* Note that the script creates two instances of JBoss BPM Suite:
** `home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc`: Business Central and Dashboard Builder, but no Intelligent Process Server
** `home/jboss/lab/bpms/kieserver`: Intelligent Process Server execution runtime, but no Business Central or Dashboard Builder
* Note that the script itself delegates to the `install-bpms-instance.sh` script in the `/opt/install/scripts/bpms` directory.

. Review the system properties (and recommended values for a JBoss BPM Suite installation) in:
.. `standalone.conf` file in `home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc/bin`
.. `standalone.conf` file in `home/jboss/lab/bpms/kieserver/bin`
** The Intelligent Process Server instance is configured with a `port-offset` of 150--the HTTP port is 8230, rather than 8080. This allows you to run both the Business Central and the Intelligent Process Server instances concurrently.
** The installed instances are configured to use the built-in H2 database. As part of the labs, you complete the configuration to reference MariaDB instead.

. Based on your review of the provided scripts and configuration files, make sure you are able to answer these questions:
* Which two users are configured for both the Intelligent Process Server and Business Central environments and what are their passwords?
* Where can you find all of the Java system properties that define the runtime behavior of the Intelligent Process Server and Business Central environments?
* Once started, which network interfaces of the VM do you expect your Intelligent Process Server and Business Central runtimes to bind to?
* Is a MySQL JDBC driver jar file already included in the VM?

ifdef::showscript[]

.Answers

* jboss / bpms  & admin / admin    :   found in install-bpms-instance.sh
* $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.conf
* All of them:   0.0.0.0           :   found in install-bpms.sh
* yes : /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar   :    found in install-bpms-instance.sh

endif::showscript[]

=== Execute Installer

In this section, you install the JBoss BPM Suite instances on the VM:

. If not already there, change to the `/home/jboss/lab` directory, and execute the `install-bpms.sh` script:
+
[source,text]
-----
./install-bpms.sh
-----
* Expect the script to complete without errors.
* The Intelligent Process Server instance is configured as an unmanaged instance.

. Uncomment the following lines to use the Business Central instance as a controller for Intelligent Process Server:
+
[source,text]
----
/home/jboss/lab/bpms/bc/bin/standalone.conf
----
+
[source,text]
----
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.user=jboss"
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.pwd=bpms"
----
+
[source,text]
----
/home/jboss/lab/bpms/kieserver/bin/standalone.conf
----
+
[source,text]
----
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.controller=http://127.0.0.1:8080/business-central/rest/controller"
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.controller.user=jboss"
#JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dorg.kie.server.controller.pwd=bpms"
----
+
NOTE: As part of the last edit above, be sure to change the default `jboss` user and `bpms` password.

== Install and Enable VirtualBox Guest Additions (Appendix)

The default display resolution of the virtual machine is a rather low 1042 x 768. Such a small display can be frustrating when you are trying to work through the labs in this course.

VirtualBox allows VMs to use the full resolution of a host's display via `Guest Additions`.

If you are using a host computer with high resolution, Red Hat recommends that you enable your VirtualBox environment to make use of `Guest Additions`.

=== Install Guest Additions

If you installed VirtualBox from link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/downloads[VirtualBox Downloads^], it comes with Guest Additions already installed.

No further tasks are required if you installed VirtualBox from the download site.

=== Enable Guest Additions in VM

. Make sure that the VM is started.
. In the top panel of the VirtualBox window, select *Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image*:
+
image::images/select_ga.png[]

. Select *Open Autorun Prompt* and click *OK*:
+
image::images/ga_prompt.png[]

. Click *Run*:
+
image::images/ga_run.png[]

. When prompted for the password of the `root` operating system user, enter `jboss` and click *Authenticate*.
* A terminal window in the VM automatically pops up and begins to build the `Guest Additions kernel modules` in the VM.

. After a minute or two, when prompted to close the window, press *Return*:
+
image::images/ga_building.png[]

. Shut down and restart the VM.
* This causes the new instance of the VM to use Guest Additions.

=== Increase VM Screen Resolution

. After the VM restarts, navigate to *System -> Preferences -> Hardware -> Displays*:
+
image::images/nav_display.png[]

. Click the *Resolution* selection list.
* Note that you now have more resolution options:
+
image::images/display_options.png[]

. Select the highest display resolution provided by your host operating system.
. At the bottom of the *Monitor Preferences* dialog, click *Apply*.
