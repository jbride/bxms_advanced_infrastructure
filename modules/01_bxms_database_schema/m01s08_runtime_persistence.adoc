== Runtime Data Persistence

* Process and task instance state
* Timers and signals
* Jobs
* Session state: Depends on runtime strategy
** Per Process Instance: Session persisted in database
** Singleton: Session serialized to disk at server shutdown
** Per Request: No session persistence
* Audit logs for processes and tasks

ifdef::showscript[]

The runtime data persistence consists in:
* Process and task instance state
* Timers and signals information
* Executor jobs and commands
* Session state depending on the runtime strategy:

When we have a PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE runtime strategy the session information is persisted in the database.
When we have a SINGLETON runtime strategy the session information is serialized to disk at server shutdown.
When we have a PER_REQUEST runtime strategy no session information is persisted.

* The runtime data persistence also contains audit logs for processes and tasks.
