.Runtime Data Persistence

* Process and task instance state
* Timers and signals
* Jobs
* Session state, depends on runtime strategy:
** Per-process instance: Session persisted in database
** Singleton: Session serialized to disk at server shutdown
** Per-request: No session persistence
* Audit logs for processes and tasks

Transcript:

Runtime data persistence consists of:

* Process and task instance state
* Timers and signals information
* Executor jobs and commands
* Session state, depending on runtime strategy:

** For per-process instance runtime strategy, the session information is persisted in the database.

** For a singleton runtime strategy, the session information is serialized to disk at server shutdown.

** For a per-request runtime strategy, no session information is persisted.

* The runtime data persistence also contains audit logs for processes and tasks.
