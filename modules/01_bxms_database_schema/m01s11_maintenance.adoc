== Database Maintenance

* Runtime data cleaned up automatically
** Process instance data (`ProcessInstanceInfo` table) removed upon process instance completion
** Task instance data (`Task` and `Content` tables) removed upon completion of owning process
** Work item information (`WorkItemInfo` table) removed upon work item completion
* Some data not removed:
** Audit data for processes and tasks
** Executor requests
** Persistent timers using Quartz
* Periodic cleaning recommended to keep database size manageable
** Copy to separate data store if audit data must be retained
** Automatic cleaning with scheduled maintenance job
*** `org.jbpm.executor.commands.LogCleanupCommand`: highly configurable example of scheduled database maintenance job.
