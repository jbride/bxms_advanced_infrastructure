== Database maintenance and cleanup

* Runtime data is cleaned up automatically
** Process instance data (Table `ProcessInstanceInfo`) is removed upon process instance completion
** Task instance data (Tables `Task`, `Content`) is removed upon completion of the owning process.
** Work item information (Table `WorkItemInfo`) is removed upon work item completion.
* Some data is not removed:
** Audit data for processes and tasks
** Executor requests
** Persistent timers using quartz
* To keep the database size manageable, periodic cleaning is recommended.
** Copy to separate data store if audit data needs to be retained.
** Periodic automatic cleaning with a scheduled job.
*** `org.jbpm.executor.commands.LogCleanupCommand` : highly configurable example of scheduled database maintenance job.
