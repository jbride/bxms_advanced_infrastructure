== Runtime Data Persistence in BPMS

* What needs to be persisted?
** Process and task instance state
** Timers and signals
** Jobs
** Session state: depends on the runtime strategy
*** _Per Process Instance_: session is persisted in the database
*** _Singleton_ : session is serialized to disk at server shutdown
*** _Per Request_ : no session persistence
** Audit logs for processes and tasks
