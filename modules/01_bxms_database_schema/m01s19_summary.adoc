Transcript:

This module examined the data persistence challenges when implementing JBoss BPM Suite. It began with a detailed discussion, with videos, of three categories of persistence: design-time data persistence, configuration and deployments persistence, and runtime data persistence. The module continued with a look at persistence technology, persistence and safe points, binary serialization, and extending persistence, followed by explanations of optimistic and pessimistic locking. The module concluded with datasource configuration and database maintenance.
