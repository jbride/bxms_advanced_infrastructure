== Datasource configuration

* Slightly different for Business Central and KIE-Server
* Use datasource defined and managed on application server.
* Business-Central: adapt `persistence.xml` in `business-central.war` to match the datasource.
* KIE-Server:: use system properties to configure persistence.
** _org.kie.server.persistence.ds_ : JNDI name of the datasource
** _org.kie.server.persistence.dialect_ : Hibernate dialect to use
* Quartz requires its own non-JTA datasource, pointing to the BPMS database.
* Datasource and database tuning:
** On the application server: pool size and settings
** On the database: query optimization with correct indexes
