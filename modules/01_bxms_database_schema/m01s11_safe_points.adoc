== Persistence and Safe Points

* In JBoss BPM Suite, state is persisted when process execution reaches safe point
** Safe points: end node, wait state, node marked as `async`
** Process executes in context of JTA transaction
** Rollback to previous persisted state in case of error

In JBoss BPM Suite the state of the process instance is persisted when the process execution reaches a safe point:
Safe points are: end nodes, wait state and nodes marked as 'async'.
As the process is executed in the context of a JTA transaction, in case of an error the transaction is rolled back to the previous persisted state.
