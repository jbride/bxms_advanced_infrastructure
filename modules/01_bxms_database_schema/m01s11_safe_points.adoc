== Persistence and Safe Points

* In JBoss BPM Suite, state is persisted when process execution reaches safe point:
** Safe points: end nodes, wait states, nodes marked `async`
** Process executes in context of JTA transaction
** If error, roll back to previous persisted state

Transcript:

In JBoss BPM Suite, the state of the process instance is persisted when the process execution reaches a safe point.

Safe points are end nodes, wait states, and nodes marked `async`.

Because the process is executed in the context of a JTA transaction, if there is an error, the transaction is rolled back to the previous persisted state.
