== Red Hat Single Sign-On Integration

* Business Central, Process Server, and Decision Server can be integrated with Red Hat Single Sign-On
* Supports SAML and OpenID Connect
* Allows passing authentication token from client application to Process Server or Decision Server
** (1) User logs in to client application and obtains token from Red Hat Single Sign-On server
** (2) Token passes through `Authorization` header of REST call to Process Server
** (3) Process Server verifies token and creates user principal
* Works well with default `UserGroupCallback` implementation if token contains required group information
