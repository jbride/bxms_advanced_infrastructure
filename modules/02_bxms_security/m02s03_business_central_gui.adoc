Transcript:

The Business Central user interface is secured with basic HTTP authentication by default. Authorization is based on user roles that are defined in the `web.xml` file in the `WEB-INF` directory of the `business-central.war` component.

The `workbench-policy.properties` file in the `WEB-INF/classes` directory of the `business-central.war` component affects the authorization process.
