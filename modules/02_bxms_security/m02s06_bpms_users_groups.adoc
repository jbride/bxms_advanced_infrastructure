== BPM Suite Users and Groups

* User task service in BPM Suite needs access to users and groups.
** User task operation are restricted to certain users and groups.
** Example: User task can only be claimed by users member of the group(s) the task was assigned to as _potential owner_.
* User and group information is not stored in the BPM Suite database.
* The process engine relies on an implementation of `org.kie.api.task.UserGroupCallback` to provide user and group information at runtime.
