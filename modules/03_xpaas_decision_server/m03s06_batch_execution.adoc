Transcript:

Because the payload to the Realtime Decision Server batch API can contain multiple batch commands, they are executed in a single transaction by the Realtime Decision Server. The commands are executed by default in a _stateless_ knowledge session.

The commands that can be executed are found in the packages `org.drools.core.command.runtime.rules.*` and `org.drools.core.command.runtime.process.*`.
