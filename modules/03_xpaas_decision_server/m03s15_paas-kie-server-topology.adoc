Transcript:

When using the binary deployment, the Realtime Decision Server topology for the deployment works this way:

. A Git server receives the changes to rules and ruleflows source code.
. When the changes are detected by webhooks, they are pulled into a Jenkins server that performs two tasks in the pipeline. First, the Jenkins server generates binaries to be uploaded to a Nexus Maven repository. Then the Jenkins server executes the `oc new-app` command with the required parameters to trigger creation of an OpenShift container.

. The OpenShift master receives the parameters from the `oc new-app` command and retrieves the required information from the Red Hat OpenShift registry and the Maven repository to create a container node.
. A new container is started in OpenShift with the given Docker image and the Maven binaries.
