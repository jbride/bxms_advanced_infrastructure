Transcript:

The Realtime Decision Server for OpenShift image does not include BRMS rules authoring tools. For rules authoring, use BRMS Business Central or the Drools plug-in of JBoss Development Studio.

The Realtime Decision Server for OpenShift assumes that the workflow to generate DRL and BPMN2 components is already in place and that the application source code contains all of the needed rules and process definition artifacts.
