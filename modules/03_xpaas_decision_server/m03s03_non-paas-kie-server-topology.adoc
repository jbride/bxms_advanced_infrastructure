ifdef::showscript[]

A Continuous Integration and Delivery can be configured for the KIE Container Deployment:
1. A git source code control server presents its changes to a Jenkins orchestrator.
2. Jenkins generates the binary files that are stored in a Nexus Maven repository and executes the pipeline that will generate a `KIE Container` in a JBoss EAP installation.
3. The Nexus Maven repository hosts the binary files so the JBoss BPMS KIE Server can found them.
4. The JBoss KIE Server web application, hosted in a JBoss EAP instance receives the notification from the Jenkins pipeline to start a new container. The `start new container` request contains information about the binary that the JBoss KIE Server web application will have to find in the Nexus repository. Then the JBoss KIE Server starts the `KIE Container` with the requested binary.
