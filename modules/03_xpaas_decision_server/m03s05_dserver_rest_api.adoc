Transcript:

Using the Realtime Decision Server REST API provides a `POST` verb implementation to execute the rules and ruleflows contained in a KIE container.

The endpoint for executing the rules through batch operations is located at: http://[kie-application-url]/services/rest/server/containers/instances/{id}, where {id} is the container ID.

This endpoint can receive a payload as a parameter. This payload can execute different methods to interact with the execution knowledge session. For example:

* `InsertObject` adds facts to the execution context.
* `StartProcess` executes a ruleflow process that specifies the rules execution order.
*`FireAllRules` fires all selected rules from the execution context.
