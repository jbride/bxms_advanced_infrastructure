== Intelligent Process Server S2I Deployments Lab

In this lab, you explore the Intelligent Process Server for OpenShift feature of JBoss BPM Suite. The Intelligent Process Server runtime is a JBoss BPM Suite Intelligent Process Server configured for deployment on OpenShift. The Intelligent Process Server for OpenShift supports source-to-image (S2I) builds, as well as binary deployments starting from prebuilt KJARs.

.Goal
* Explore S2I functionality of Intelligent Process Server for OpenShift

.Requirements
* Completion of the labs covering Realtime Decision Server for OpenShift in the previous module.
* A local workstation with the following installed:
** OpenShift CLI client (`oc`)
** Git
** Maven
** cURL

NOTE: The lab VM used in this course has the local workstation tools installed.

:numbered:

== Set Up Lab Environment

. Log in to the OpenShift environment using the OpenShift CLI tool:
+
[source,text]
----
$ oc login https://master.na.openshift.opentlc.com
----
* If you are using a hosted environment, use the credentials provided to you.

* After logging in, all CLI commands target a project provided for you in the lab environment.

. Open a browser, navigate to the OpenShift Container Platform 3 URL, and access the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
. Log in using the same credentials you used for the CLI.
+
[NOTE]
Some tasks in this lab are identical to the tasks in the first lab in module 3--for example, setting up the Git and Nexus repositories. Detailed instructions for these sections are not repeated in this lab. Refer to the instructions in the first lab in module 3 if needed.

=== Run Gogs Git Server

If you completed the labs in module 3, expect the Gogs server to be up and running. If not, refer to the first lab in module 3 for detailed instructions on how to install the Gogs Git server on OpenShift.

. Log in to the Gogs server with the username and password you used in the previous labs.
. Create an organization called `process-server-s2i`.
. Verify that you are a member of the new organization and listed as `owner`.
. Create a repository in the `process-server-s2i` organization with the name `policyquote`.
* Make sure that the repository is not private.
* Make sure that the *Initialize this repository with selected file and template* box is not checked.
. Click *Create repository*.
+
[NOTE]
Later in the lab, you push the JBoss BPM Suite project to this repository.

=== Use Nexus Maven Repository Server

If you completed the labs in module 3, expect the Nexus server to be up and running. If not, refer to the first lab in module 3 for detailed instructions on how to install the Nexus server on OpenShift.

=== Intelligent Process Server ImageStream and S2I Template

The ImageStream for the Intelligent Process Server image is reused by different templates in this lab.

. In the VM, open a terminal and change to the directory in the cloned lab project that contains the templates for this lab:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-lab/xpaas/process-server
----
. Review the `processserver-63-is.yaml` definition file.
* This file defines the ImageStream for the Intelligent Process Server 6.3 image, hosted in Red Hat's Docker registry.
* The latest version of this image is 1.3.

. Create the ImageStream for the Intelligent Process Server image:
+
[source,text]
----
$ oc create -f processserver-63-is.yaml
----
+
NOTE: The Intelligent Process Server requires a database. For this lab, you use MySQL with the MySQL data directory attached to persistent storage.

. Review the BuildConfig for the S2I build in the `processserver-mysql-persistent-s2i.yaml` template and the related BuildConfig objects:

* The BuildConfig defines the source build, pointing to a Git repository as well as the builder image, through the ImageStream defined earlier.
** The build is triggered through a webhook or by a change in the builder image.
** The webhook is triggered whenever new code is pushed to the Git repository.
* The ImageStream is created for the image as a result of the build.
* A DeploymentConfig is created for the pod's running image as result of the build.
** The number of replicas is set to 1.
* A Service is created for the Intelligent Process Server.
* A Route is created for the Intelligent Process Server.
+
[NOTE]
The Intelligent Process Server uses an insecure HTTP route, not HTTPS.

* A DeploymentConfig is created for the MySQL database pod.
** The source image is the MySQL Docker image shipped as part of OpenShift.
** The MySQL data directory is mounted as a volume.
* The PersistentVolumeClaim is created for the MySQL data volume.
* A Service is created for the MySQL database to expose the MySQL database to the process engine pods.

. Review the set of parameters in the `processserver-mysql-persistent-s2i.yaml` template as shown here:
+
[cols="3",options="header"]

== Prepare Policy Quote Process Application

The `policyquote-process` sample application is a simple JBoss BPM Suite application, consisting of a single process model and a data model with a `Driver` object and a `Policy` object. A process is started with an instance of these objects as process variables.

The process consists of a `SetPrice` User Task assigned to the `agent` group, and a `ReviewPrice` User Task assigned to the `reviewer` group. The `ReviewPrice` task is executed only if the price set by the `agent` user is more than `500`:

image::images/policyquote-process.png[]

The application, developed in Business Central, can be imported into Business Central for review, extension, or modification.

In this section, you clone the `policyquote-process` project from GitHub, and push it to the Gogs server on OpenShift to act as source for the S2I build.

. In the VM, open a terminal window and change to the lab home folder:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab
----

. Clone the `policyquote-process` project from the following GitHub site:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/bxms-xpaas-policyquote-process
----

. Add a remote repository to the cloned project pointing to the Gogs server:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd bxms-xpaas-policyquote-process
$ git remote add gogs http://<gogs username>:<gogs password>@<url of the gogs route>/process-server-s2i/policyquote.git
----

* Replace `<gogs username>`, `<gogs password>`, and `<url of the gogs route>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

. Push the code to the Gogs server:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git push gogs master
----

== Create Users and Roles

You must define users and roles for the `policyquote-process` application. By default, the Intelligent Process Server uses properties files to define users and roles, and you use the same mechanism for the lab.

The Intelligent Process Server image comes with empty properties files for application users and roles. In this section, you populate the properties files with users and roles and add these to the S2I build. This can be done by adding the properties files to a folder called `configuration` in the build root folder of the project. As part of the S2I build, the contents of the `configuration` folder is copied to the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration` folder on the image. The user defined in the template (`KIE_SERVER_USER/KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD`) is also added to the properties files during the S2I build.

. Change to the `policyquote-process` directory of the cloned `policyquote-process` project:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd policyquote-process
----
* This directory contains the POM file for the application.

. Create a directory called `configuration`, and create two files, called `application-users.properties` and `application-roles.properties`:
+
[source,text]
----
$ mkdir configuration
$ touch configuration/application-users.properties
$ touch configuration/application-roles.properties
----

. Using a text editor, open the `configuration/application-users.properties` file.

. Copy and paste the following contents into the file and save it:
+
[source,text]
----
user1=e6e3515c498a9dd0d3f9ff109a563d70
user10=aab70ed7128574f33830762d5a7706b8
user11=d52988665526b974adda93cbd3af9657
user2=60a186310ff25f5eaf61371df513e9dd
user20=63b620eaa18caf1df6a29891a24f5338
user21=37e033fbd7f1398e9897b7bba355338b
----

* All users have the password `user`.

. Open the `configuration/application-roles.properties` file.

. Copy and paste the following contents into the file and save it:
+
[source,text]
----
user1=kie-server,agent
user10=kie-server,agent
user11=kie-server,agent
user2=kie-server,reviewer
user21=kie-server,reviewer
user22=kie-server,reviewer
----

* Note that all users require the `kie-server` role to use the Intelligent Process Server's REST API.

. Add the files to Git, commit, and push to Gogs:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git add configuration/application-users.properties
$ git add configuration/application-roles.properties
$ git commit -m "users and roles for the application"
$ git push gogs master
----

== Create Policy Quote Process Application

. In the VM, open a terminal window, and change to the directory in the cloned lab project that contains the templates for the Intelligent Process Server lab:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-lab/xpaas/process-server
----

. Create the application:
+
[source,text]
----
$ export application_name=policyquote
$ export source_repo=http://gogs:3000/process-server-s2i/policyquote.git
$ export context_dir=policyquote-process
$ export nexus_url=http://nexus:8081
$ export kieserver_password=kieserver1!
$ export is_namespace=$(oc project | awk '{gsub(/"/,"",$3); print $3}')
$ export kie_container_deployment="policyquote-process=com.redhat.gpte.xpaas.process-server:policyquote-process:1.0-SNAPSHOT"
$ oc new-app --template=processserver63-mysql-persistent-s2i -p APPLICATION_NAME=$application_name -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=$source_repo -p CONTEXT_DIR=$context_dir -p KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD=$kieserver_password -p IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=$is_namespace -p KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT=$kie_container_deployment -p KIE_CONTAINER_REDIRECT_ENABLED=false -p MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=$nexus_url/content/groups/public/
----

* The `KIE_CONTAINER_REDIRECT_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `false`. This means that the name of the KIE container for the application is `policyquote-process`, as defined in `KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT`.

* You must specify the context directory for the build, which corresponds to the directory containing the POM file. This is the base directory for the S2I build.

. Check the progress of the build and deployment of the application in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* The S2I build takes place in the `policyquote-1-build` builder pod.
+
NOTE: If you finished the labs in module 3, expect the build to be quick, as the Nexus Maven proxy is already seeded with the build dependencies. Most of the build time is spent pushing the built Docker image to the internal registry.

. Check the logs for the `policyquote-1-build` pod using the OpenShift CLI:
+
[source,text]
----
$ oc logs -f policyquote-1-build
----
* Alternatively, you can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console for this step.

* At the end of the build cycle, expect to see similar results in the builder pod log:
+

* The image built by the builder pod is pushed to the OpenShift internal registry. This triggers the deployment of the image.

. Use the OpenShift CLI to identify the ID of the `policyquote` application pod that was just  started and is hosting the Intelligent Process Server.
. Check this application pod's logs to ensure that the `policyquote-process` KIE container was deployed and started correctly in this Intelligent Process Server:

== Review Application Life Cycle

Managing changes in a Intelligent Process Server application is more complex than with Realtime Decision Server applications because of the state involved with processes versus the stateless nature of business rule invocations.

With Realtime Decision Server applications, you can simply build new pods with the new version of the rules application and do a rolling upgrade of the existing application pods.

This is not possible with process servers. If there are still process instances in a wait state for the old version, chances are high that these will not execute correctly with a new process definition--depending, of course, on the nature of the changes introduced. In a development or test environment you might recreate a complete new application, including the database pods, as you are probably less interested in dangling process instances from previous versions. But in a production environment this is, of course, unacceptable.

In a production environment, you need to be able to retain the previous process deployments next to the new ones, at least as long as you have running process instances for these previous versions.

The Intelligent Process Server for OpenShift images provide a mechanism to achieve this by using KIE container aliases and redirects. You explore this mechanism in the next lab.
