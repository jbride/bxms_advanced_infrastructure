== Process Server Binary Deployment Lab

Because of the state involved with processes versus the stateless nature of business rules invocations, managing changes in a Process Server application is more complex than with Decision Server applications.

With Decision Server applications, you can simply build new pods with the new version of the rules application and perform a rolling upgrade of the existing application pods.

This is not possible with Process Servers. If there are still process instances in a wait state from the earlier version, these stand a good chance of not executing correctly with a new process definition (depending, of course, on the nature of the changes introduced).

In a development or test environment, you can recreate a complete new application, including the database pods, because you are likely less interested in dangling process instances from previous versions. But this is not acceptable in a production environment. In that case, you must be able to retain the previous process deployments at the same time that you deploy later versions, at least as long as you have running process instances for these previous versions.

The Process Server images provide a mechanism to achieve this, by using KIE container aliases and redirects. You explore this mechanism in this lab. You use the binary variant of the S2I build. When deploying a new version of the application, the previous versions (KIE containers) are retained. This allows exiting process instances to continue executing in their original container. New process instances are started in the new container. This is transparent to the clients.

To demonstrate that OpenShift and xPaaS are not limited to DevOps (where every commit potentially results in a new production deployment), you simulate a more traditional Git release process. In this release model, development is done on the master branch, and when the application is ready to be released, the master branch is merged to the release branch. Deployment is triggered from the release branch.

== Set Up Gogs Git Server

In this section, you first create a new organization and set up an owner and a team. Then you create a repository on the Gogs server and push a new clone of the `policyquote-process` project to Gogs.

=== Create Organization, User, Team, and Repository

. Open a browser, navigate to the Gogs server home page, and log in with your username and password.
. Create a new organization called `process-server-jenkins`.
. Add a `jenkins` user to the `owner` team of the `process-server-jenkins` organization.
. Create a repository named `policyquote-process` in the `process-server-jenkins` organization on the Gogs server.

=== Clone Project and Push to Gogs

In this section, you clone the `policyquote-process` project and push the clone to the Gogs server repository.

. Open a terminal window, change to the lab home directory, and clone the `policyquote-process` project from GitHub:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/bxms-xpaas-policyquote-process policyquote-process
----

. Add a remote repository to the cloned project pointing to the Gogs server:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd policyquote-process
$ git remote add gogs http://<gogs username>:<gogs password>@<url of the gogs route>/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process.git
----
* Replace "<gogs username>", "<gogs password>", and "<url of the gogs route>" with the values that you set for the  environment in the _OpenShift Decision Server Lab_.

. Push the code to the Gogs server:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git push gogs master
----

== Configure Jenkins Build Server Job

You set up the Jenkins build server in the previous lab. The Jenkins server is preconfigured with the `policyquote` and `policyquote-process` build jobs. In this lab, you use the `policyquote-process` build job:

image::images/jenkins-master-policyquote-process.png[]

. Click the `policyquote-process` job, and then click *Configure*.
. Note that the `policyquote-process` job uses a pipeline, but the script field is empty, so no pipeline script is defined yet.
* You add the pipeline script in the next section of the lab.
* The `policyquote-process` is a parameterized build. It takes the branch name to build as a parameter, allowing Jenkins to make a distinction between builds of the master and release branches. Only the release branch builds trigger deployments on OpenShift.

=== Commit Process Server Deployment Marker Project

In this lab, you use Jenkins to build the kjar, so there is no need to rebuild the same kjar on the Process Server. But you still have to tell the Process Server what needs to be deployed.

In this section, you use a Git project that contains a properties file with a property pointing to the release IDs (Maven GAVs, or `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`) of the kjars to be deployed. You also add the files containing the users and roles to this project.

. Prepare the Gogs server:
.. In the lab VM, open a browser and navigate to the Gogs server on OpenShift.
.. Log in with your username and password.
.. Create a repository named `policyquote-process-ocp` in the `process-server-jenkins` organization on the Gogs server.

. In the lab VM, open a terminal window and change to the lab home folder:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab
----

. Create the `policyquote-process-ocp/.s2i` and `policyquote-process/configuration` directories, and change to the `policyquote-process-ocp` directory:
+
[source,text]
----
$ mkdir -p policyquote-process-ocp/.s2i
$ mkdir -p policyquote-process-ocp/configuration
$ cd policyquote-process-ocp
----

. Create a file called `environment` in the `policyquote-process-ocp/.s2i` folder:
+
[source,text]
----
$ touch .s2i/environment
----

. Open the `environment` file for editing, and set the contents to:
+
[source,text]
----
KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=
----

* The GAVs of the kjars and of the KIE container alias to be deployed are appended to this line as part of the build job on Jenkins.

. Create a file called `application-users.properties` in the `configuration` directory:
+
[source,text]
----
$ touch configuration/application-users.properties
----

. Using a text editor, open the `configuration/application-users.properties` file.

. Paste the following contents in the file and save the file:
+
[source,text]
----
user1=e6e3515c498a9dd0d3f9ff109a563d70
user10=aab70ed7128574f33830762d5a7706b8

user21=37e033fbd7f1398e9897b7bba355338b
----

. Create a file called `application-roles.properties` in the `configuration` directory:
+
[source,text]
----
$ touch configuration/application-roles.properties
----

. Using a text editor, open the `configuration/application-roles.properties` file.

. Paste the following contents in the file and save the file:
+
[source,text]
----
user1=kie-server,agent
user10=kie-server,agent
user11=kie-server,agent
user2=kie-server,reviewer
user21=kie-server,reviewer
user22=kie-server,reviewer
----

. Push the project to the Gogs server:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git init
$ git remote add gogs http://<gogs username>:<gogs password>@<url of the gogs route>/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process-ocp.git
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git push gogs master
----

=== Add Jenkins Build Pipeline

In this section, you add the Jenkins build pipeline script to the `policyquote-process` build job in Jenkins.

. Open a browser, navigate to the Jenkins home page on OpenShift, and log in.
. Click the `policyquote-process` job, and then click *Configure*.
. Scroll down to the *Pipeline* definition section:
+
image::images/policyquote-pipeline.png[]

. In the *Script* pane, paste the following contents:
+
[source,groovy]
----
node('jdk8') {
  def mvnHome = tool 'M3'
  def mvnCmd = "${mvnHome}/bin/mvn -s ${env.JENKINS_HOME}/settings.xml -f policyquote-process/pom.xml"

  stage 'Build'
    git url: 'http://jenkins:password@gogs:3000/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process.git', branch: "${branch}"
    def groupId = getGroupIdFromPom("policyquote-process/pom.xml")
    def artifactId = getArtifactIdFromPom("policyquote-process/pom.xml")
    def version = getVersionFromPom("policyquote-process/pom.xml")
    echo "Building branch ${branch} - version ${version}"
    sh "${mvnCmd} clean package -DskipTests=true"

  stage 'Test'
    try {
      sh "${mvnCmd} test"
    } catch (err) {
      step([$class: 'JUnitResultArchiver', testResults: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'])
      throw err
    }

  if ("${branch}".startsWith("release")) {
    stage 'Publish'
      sh "${mvnCmd} deploy -DskipTests=true -DaltDeploymentRepository=nexus::default::http://nexus:8081/content/repositories/releases"

    stage 'Deploy to STAGING'
      git url: 'http://jenkins:password@gogs:3000/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process-ocp.git'
      sh "sed -r -i \"s/^KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=(.*)[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\$/&|/\" .s2i/environment"
      sh "sed -r -i \"s/^KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=.*/&policyquote-process=${groupId}:${artifactId}:${version}/\" .s2i/environment"
      def commit = "Release " + version
      sh "git add .s2i/environment && git commit -m \"${commit}\" && git push origin master"
      //openshiftBuild bldCfg: 'policyquote', namespace: '<openshift project>'
  }

}

def getVersionFromPom(pom) {
  def matcher = readFile(pom) =~ '<version>(.+)</version>'
  matcher ? matcher[0][1] : null
 }

def getGroupIdFromPom(pom) {
  def matcher = readFile(pom) =~ '<groupId>(.+)</groupId>'
  matcher ? matcher[0][1] : null
 }

def getArtifactIdFromPom(pom) {
  def matcher = readFile(pom) =~ '<artifactId>(.+)</artifactId>'
  matcher ? matcher[0][1] : null
}
----

. Review the Jenkins pipeline:
* All the stages run on slave nodes labeled `jdk8`.
* The `Build` stage checks out the kjar source code project from Gogs.
** The GAV of the project is determined from the project POM file.
** The project is built using Maven. Test execution is skipped in this phase.
* In the `Test` stage, unit tests are executed using `mvn test`.
* If the project has integration, performance, or behavior-driven test suites, they are executed in their own stages following the test stage. Stages can be run in parallel to speed up build time.
* The `Publish` and `Deploy to Staging` phases are executed only if the branch being built is a release branch.
* In the `Publish` stage, the build artifacts are published to the Nexus repository using `mvn deploy`.
* In the `Deploy to Staging` stage, the marker project created in the previous step is checked out. The GAV of the project is appended to the value of the `KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE` with the `policyquote-process` container alias. The change is committed and pushed.
* A new build of the `policyquote` application on OpenShift is triggered using the `oc` client, which replaces the current Process Server application with a new one that contains a KIE container for each of the GAVs specified in `KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE`.
+
[NOTE]
The OpenShift build step is commented out, as the `policyquote` application is not created yet.

. Save the script.

== Prepare for Release and Execute Build

=== Set Up Project Release

. In the VM, change to the directory with the cloned `policyquote-process` project:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab/policyquote-process
----

. Create the `release` branch, check out the branch, and set the project version to `1.0.0`:
+
----
$ git branch release
$ git checkout release
$ mvn versions:set -f policyquote-process/pom.xml -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=1.0.0
$ git add policyquote-process/pom.xml
$ git commit -m "release 1.0.0"
----

. Push the release branch to Gogs:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git push gogs release
----

. Increase the version of the master branch to `1.1-SNAPSHOT`:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git checkout master
$ mvn versions:set -f policyquote-process/pom.xml -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT
$ git add policyquote-process/pom.xml
$ git commit -m "master version 1.1-SNAPSHOT"
----

=== Execute Build Pipeline

In this section, you execute the `policyquote-process` pipeline on the Jenkins server.

. On the `policyquote-process` build job page, click *Build with Parameters*.
. Specify `release` for the *branch* parameter and click *Build*:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-pipeline-branch.png[]

. Watch as the build moves through its different stages:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-pipeline-build-2.png[]

. Note that the Jenkins build job is executed on a slave node, which runs on a dedicated pod, spawned for the duration of the build:
+
image::images/jenkins-slave-pod.png[]

. Note that the Nexus repository contains the `1.0.0` version of the `policyquote-process` kjar archive:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-kjar-nexus.png[]

. Verify that the value of the `KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE` property in the `.s2i/environment` file of the `policyquote-ocp` project is set to the `policyquote-process=com.redhat.gpte.xpaas.process-server:policyquote-process:1.0.0` value:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-deployment-override.png[]

=== Deploy Process Server Application

In this section, you deploy the Process Server application for the `policyquote-process` kjar.

. In the VM, open a terminal window and change to the directory in the cloned lab project that contains the templates for this lab:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-lab/xpaas/process-server
----

. Issue the following commands to create the application, replacing expressions between "< >" with correct values for your environment:
+
[source,text]
----
$ application_name=policyquote
$ source_repo=http://gogs:3000/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process-ocp.git
$ nexus_url=http://nexus:8081
$ kieserver_password=kieserver1!
$ is_namespace=<name of your OpenShift project>
$ oc new-app --template=processserver63-mysql-persistent-s2i -p APPLICATION_NAME=$application_name,SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=$source_repo,KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD=$kieserver_password,IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=$is_namespace,KIE_CONTAINER_REDIRECT_ENABLED=true,MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=$nexus_url/content/groups/public/
----

. Once the deployment of the Process Server is finished, use `curl` to check that the containers deployed.

* Expect to see the following response:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "SUCCESS",
  "msg": "List of created containers",
  "result": {
    "kie-containers": {
      "kie-container": [
        {
          "status": "STARTED",
          "messages": [
            {
              "severity": "INFO",
              "timestamp": 1477908565571,
              "content": [
                "Container 3a9d813a567dbc0c5c178f538d3be890 successfully created with module com.redhat.gpte.xpaas.process-server:policyquote-process:1.0.0."
              ]
            }
          ],
          "container-id": "3a9d813a567dbc0c5c178f538d3be890",
          "release-id": {
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "group-id": "com.redhat.gpte.xpaas.process-server",
            "artifact-id": "policyquote-process"
          },
          "resolved-release-id": {
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "group-id": "com.redhat.gpte.xpaas.process-server",
            "artifact-id": "policyquote-process"
          },
          "config-items": []
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----
+
[NOTE]
The KIE container name is a hexadecimal string. This is because the value of the `KIE_CONTAINER_REDIRECT_ENABLED` parameter is set to `true`. From the client side, however, you use the container alias `policyquote-process` name for the KIE container in the REST API calls. The redirection mechanism resolves the alias to the correct target KIE container.

. Create a few process instances using `curl` with `policyquote-process` as the KIE container name.

* Make sure you keep at least one process instance in a User Task wait state before proceeding with the remainder of the lab.

=== Complete and Automate Jenkins Build Pipeline

To complete the pipeline, you trigger a Jenkins build when code is committed into the `policyquote-process` source repository, and have the Jenkins build start a new build of the Process Server application at the end of the build pipeline.

. Open a browser, navigate to the Gogs server, log in, and go to the `process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process` repository.
. Click *Settings*, and then click *Git Hooks*.
. Click the pencil next to `post-receive`.

. Under the *Hook Content*, paste this script:
+
[source,text]
----
#!/bin/bash

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)
    if [[ "$branch" == "master" || "$branch" == release* ]]; then
    	curl -X POST --user admin:password http://jenkins:8080/job/policyquote-process/buildWithParameters?branch=${branch}&token=mysecret
    fi
done
----

* This script signals the Jenkins `policyquote` build job every time a commit is received in the master or release branch.

. Click *Update Hook*.
. Go to the Jenkins server page, select the `policyquote-jenkins` job, and click *Configure*.
. In the pipeline script, uncomment the last line of the `Deploy to Staging` stage, replacing "<openshift project>" with the name of your OpenShift project:
+
[source,groovy]
----
    stage 'Deploy to STAGING'
      git url: 'http://jenkins:password@gogs:3000/process-server-jenkins/policyquote-process-ocp.git'
      sh "sed -r -i \"s/^KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=(.*)[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\$/&|/\" .s2i/environment"
      sh "sed -r -i \"s/^KIE_CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_OVERRIDE=.*/&policyquote-process=${groupId}:${artifactId}:${version}/\" .s2i/environment"
      def commit = "Release " + version
      sh "git add .s2i/environment && git commit -m \"${commit}\" && git push origin master"
      openshiftBuild bldCfg: 'policyquote', namespace: '<openshift project>'
----

. Save the pipeline.

== Release New Version of Application

In this section, you introduce a change in the `policyquote-process` project and trigger a new release of the application.

. In the VM, change to the directory with the cloned `policyquote-process` project:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd /home/jboss/lab/policyquote-process
----

. Check out the master branch:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git checkout master
----

. Change the version of the process definition and the log statement in the last node of the process instance to simulate a change in the project:
+
[source,text]
----
$ sed -i 's/drools:version="1.0"/drools:version="2.0"/' policyquote-process/src/main/resources/PolicyQuoteProcess.bpmn2
$ sed -i 's/Driver /Version 2 : Driver /' policyquote-process/src/main/resources/PolicyQuoteProcess.bpmn2
----

. Commit the changes to the master branch:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git add policyquote-process/src/main/resources/PolicyQuoteProcess.bpmn2
$ git commit -m "PolicyQuoteProcess version 2"
----

. In the master branch, cherry-pick the commit to the release branch:
.. Find the commit hash:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git log -n 1
----

* Expect the results to look similar to this:
+
[source,text]
----

.. Increase the project version of the release branch to `1.1.0`:
+
[source,text]
----
$ mvn versions:set -f policyquote-process/pom.xml -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=1.1.0
$ git add policyquote-process/pom.xml
$ git commit -m "release 1.1.0"
----

.. Push the release branch to Gogs:
+
[source,text]
----
$ git push gogs release
----

* The push to Gogs triggers the post-receive hook, starts a Jenkins build, and triggers a new build and deployment of the `policy-quote` application on OpenShift:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-application-build.png[]

* A container definition for the version `1.1.0` of the kjar is added to the `KIE_CONTAINER_REDIRECT_ENABLED` variable in the  `.s2i/environment` file of the `policyquote-ocp` project:
+
image::images/policyquote-process-deployment-override-2.png[]

* The `policyquote-process` server application has two deployed containers, resolving to the `1.0.0` and `1.1.0` versions of the kjar:
