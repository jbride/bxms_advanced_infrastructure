== Client Targeting

* In most cases clients must target particular container by name to execute server-side functions

* Actual container IDs on server renamed by client code by:

** Full deployment part: `processserver-library=org.openshift.quickstarts:processserver-library:1.3.1.Final`
** Full deployment hash: `e8d626d14a44bf3cf1f127ae9fdabc91`
** Deployment alias (client redirects): `processserver-library`

Transcript:

When the client application uses the Intelligent Process Server endpoints to consume its services, in most cases clients must target a particular container by name to execute the server-side functions.

The client can find the proper container by using the full deployment part, using the deployment hash, or using the deployment alias. This triggers `CLIENT REDIRECT` functionality, which is explained next.
