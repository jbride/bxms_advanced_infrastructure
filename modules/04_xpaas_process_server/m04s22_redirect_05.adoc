== Client Targeting

* In most cases, clients must target particular container by name to execute server-side functions

* Actual container IDs on the server renamed--client code can do this by:

** Full deployment part: `processserver-library=org.openshift.quickstarts:processserver-library:1.3.1.Final`
** Full deployment hash: `e8d626d14a44bf3cf1f127ae9fdabc91`
** Deployment alias (Client Redirects): `processserver-library`

When the client application is to use the Process Server endpoints to consume its services: in most cases, clients must target a particular container by name to execute the server-side functions.
The client can find the proper container by:
* Using the full deployment part
* Using the deployment hash _or_
* Using the deployment Alias: This will trigger a CLIENT REDIRECT functionality that we are about to explain.
