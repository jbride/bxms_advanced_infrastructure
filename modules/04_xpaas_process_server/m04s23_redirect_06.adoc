Transcript:

When using the deployment alias, the incoming request is redirected to a specific deployed container in the server. For this purpose, a multistep container resolution process is used to determine which version of the container is targeted by the redirect.

The process is followed in the REST interface by using a servlet filter, or followed in the JMS interface by using an EJB interceptor.
